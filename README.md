# PeatlandForest_RF

Ahtikoski et al. (2026) working notes

Repository contains Python codes for calculating radiative forcing (RFs) for alternative scenarios of drained peatland forest management. We compare optimal even-aged forestry (EAF), continuous-cover forestry (CCF) and restoration to tree-covered or open mires.

Methodology to calculate RFs for each management / land-use change scenario follows Launiainen et al. (2025) Ambio -paper. We consider separately RF's from CO2, CH4, N2O and methane, and potentially include also albedo change. 
We model separately the impacts of soil greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, tree stand C storage, harvest residues left to the site, and fate of long-term vs. short-term wood product carbon.

Average RF's at given timeframe are compared, and the cost of climate mitigation compared to economic gains/losses. Thinking how to use CO2 and CH4 costs of emission trading to value sinks/sources
